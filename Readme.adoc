== Neo4j Property Graph Schema Extractor
This code accompanies my research on defining a methodology for the extraction of a schema from a property graph. For a detailed explanation, find the related paper here (link). 
=== How to execute the schema extractor:
- Start a local Neo4j Server (http://neo4j.com/download[Download & Install]).
- Execute the jar file from the command line or an IDE:
 java -jar .\schemagenerator-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar (optional: link to Neo4J bolt connector)
- The resulting schema is written to an output-file: 'schema.txt'

This code is intended as a prototype, configuration parameters might need to be adjusted in the source. This code uses a variety of open source libraries for distribution fitting, association rule mining and more. Feel free to contact me for more information.
